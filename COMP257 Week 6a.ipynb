    "This notebook presents a problem that requires some normalisation of data before a linear regression model can be applied.    The data we will use is the Sea Ice data from Chapter 6 of the text (also referenced in [the accompanying notebooks](https://github.com/MQCOMP257/introduction-datascience-python-book/blob/master/ch06_Regression_Analysis.ipynb)).  Our goal is to observe the relationship between `year` and `extent` of the Sea Ice and to build a linear regression model to predict the extent for a given year."
