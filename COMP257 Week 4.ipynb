    "We will follow examples from [this Python Seaborn tutorial](https://elitedatascience.com/python-seaborn-tutorial) by EliteDataScience.   [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python library that sits on top of matplotlib and Pandas and gives us a richer collection of plots than the basic plot method.   Unfortunately (for us), there has just (July 2018) been a new release of Seaborn that is incompatible with the version installed in Anaconda; the official tutorial and documentation refer to the new version so it is a bit hard to find help.  Luckily the tutorial I've linked above is a pretty good walk through of the major plot styles so should be useful.  You can find documentation and examples of the older version of Seaborn via the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20180630204548/http://seaborn.pydata.org/).  \n",
